# Ruby Recursion: Fibonacci Sequence

## Project Overview
This project is part of the "Project: Recursion" lesson from The Odin Project. The main focus of this assignment is to understand and implement recursion in Ruby, specifically through the Fibonacci sequence. The project involves two primary tasks:

1. Implementing an iterative method (`#fibs`) to generate a Fibonacci sequence.
2. Implementing a recursive method (`#fibs_rec`) to generate a Fibonacci sequence.

## Objective
The key objective of this assignment is to deepen my understanding of recursion in Ruby. By comparing iterative and recursive approaches to the same problem, I aim to gain insights into the efficiency, readability, and scalability of recursive methods.

## Key Learning Points
- **Understanding Recursion**: Grasping the concept of recursion and how it can be applied to solve problems in Ruby.
- **Iterative vs Recursive Approaches**: Comparing and contrasting iterative and recursive solutions to understand their use cases and performance implications.
- **Ruby Programming**: Enhancing my Ruby coding skills, focusing on syntax, logic implementation, and problem-solving.

## Assignment Details
1. **Iterative Fibonacci (`#fibs`)**: Write a method that takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence. For example, an input of `8` should return `[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]`.
2. **Recursive Fibonacci (`#fibs_rec`)**: Implement the same functionality as `#fibs` but using a recursive approach.

## Getting Started
To tackle this assignment, follow these steps:

1. **Setup**: Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. **Implementation**: Start by implementing the `#fibs` method using iteration. Test it with various inputs to ensure accuracy.
3. **Recursive Method**: Implement the `#fibs_rec` method. Test it similarly to ensure it works as expected.
4. **Comparison and Analysis**: Compare both methods in terms of code complexity, readability, and performance.

## Conclusion
This assignment is a practical exercise in understanding and implementing recursion in Ruby. It provides a foundational understanding of how recursion can be a powerful tool in a programmer's toolkit, especially when dealing with problems that have a natural recursive structure like the Fibonacci sequence.

I am excited to explore the depths of recursion and apply these concepts to more complex problems in the future.
